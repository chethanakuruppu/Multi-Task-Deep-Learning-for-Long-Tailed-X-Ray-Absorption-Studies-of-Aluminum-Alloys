# Multi-Task-Deep-Learning-for-Long-Tailed-X-Ray-Absorption-Studies-of-Aluminum-Alloys
This study uses X-ray imaging and multi-task CNNs to analyze five aluminum alloys across different thicknesses. A tailored imbalance-aware method addresses long-tailed data, enabling accurate alloy classification and absorption analysis, advancing AI-driven material characterization.

This project analyzes five aluminum-based alloys: **Al 1050 (pure aluminum), Al 2017 (Al–Cu), Al 5083 (Al–Mg), Al 6082 (Al–Si–Mg), and Al 7075 (Al–Zn–Mg)**. We use a multi-task CNN framework to simultaneously classify alloy type and predict thickness-dependent absorption. To handle challenges from long-tailed data distributions, an imbalance-aware training method was applied, improving both robustness and generalization of the model.
